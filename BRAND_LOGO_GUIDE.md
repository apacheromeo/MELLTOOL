   - Quick and simple
   - No file size concerns
   - Predefined set of icons
   - Works great for generic brands

2. **Image Upload** 📸
   - Professional brand logos
   - Supports PNG, JPG formats
   - Up to 2MB file size

### Where Logos Appear

---

## Important: Copyright & Trademarks

### ⚠️ Legal Considerations

**Why we can't automatically download logos:**
1. Brand logos are **copyrighted** and **trademarked**
2. Unauthorized use can violate intellectual property laws
3. Each brand has specific usage guidelines

**Legal ways to use brand logos:**
1. **Official Press Kits**: Many brands provide logos for authorized retailers
2. **Retailer Portals**: If you're an authorized dealer, use their assets
3. **Fair Use**: As a retailer selling legitimate products, you can display brand logos for identification purposes
4. **Permission**: Contact brands directly for logo usage rights

### Safe Usage Guidelines

✅ **Acceptable**:
- Using official logos from brand press kits
- Displaying logos for products you legitimately sell
- Identifying brands accurately in your inventory

❌ **Avoid**:
- Modifying or altering brand logos
- Using logos to imply false endorsement
- Downloading from random websites (may be low quality or modified)

## How to Find Official Brand Logos

### Method 1: Brand Official Websites

Most brands provide logo downloads in their press/media sections:

**Example URLs to try:**
```
https://[brand-website]/press
https://[brand-website]/media
https://[brand-website]/about/logos
https://[brand-website]/brand-assets
```

**Common brands with press kits:**

- **Philips**: philips.com/global/about-philips/company/press

### Method 2: Authorized Retailer Portals

If you're an authorized dealer:
1. Login to your dealer portal
2. Look for "Marketing Materials" or "Brand Assets"
3. Download approved logos and images
4. Use these in your MELLTOOL system

### Method 3: Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons

For many well-known brands:
1. Visit Wikipedia page for the brand
2. Right-click on the logo image
3. Click "Save image as..."
4. Upload to MELLTOOL

**Example**: [Samsung Logo on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung)

### Method 4: Contact Brand Representatives

For brands you actively sell:
1. Contact your brand representative
2. Request official logo files
3. Mention you're an authorized retailer
4. Ask for preferred logo format (PNG with transparent background is best)

## Troubleshooting

### Logo Doesn't Display

**Problem**: Uploaded logo but it doesn't show

**Solutions**:
1. **Check file size**: Must be under 2MB
   - If too large, use image compression tool: [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com)
2. **Check file format**: Must be JPG or PNG
   - Convert if needed: [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com)
3. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
4. **Re-upload**: Delete and upload again

### Logo Looks Pixelated

**Problem**: Logo appears blurry or low quality

**Solutions**:
1. Find higher resolution version (minimum 300x300px)
2. Download from official source
3. Avoid screenshotting logos - download the actual file

### Logo Has Wrong Background

**Problem**: Logo has white/colored background instead of transparent

**Solutions**:
1. Look for PNG version with transparency
2. Use online background remover: [Remove.bg](https://remove.bg)
3. Ask brand representative for PNG with transparent background

### Logo Too Large

**Problem**: File size exceeds 2MB

**Solutions**:
1. Compress image: [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) or [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app)
2. Resize to smaller dimensions (500x500px is sufficient)
3. Convert to PNG if it's JPG (PNG with transparency is often smaller)

### Can't Find Official Logo

**Solutions**:
1. Use emoji placeholder temporarily
2. Contact brand sales representative
3. Check if you're an authorized dealer - access dealer portal
4. Use Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons version

download (1).png
```

### Backup Your Logo Files

## Advanced: Bulk Logo Management

**Current Limitation**: Logos must be uploaded one at a time through the UI

**Future Enhancement Possibility**:
If you frequently add many brands, you could request a bulk logo import feature similar to the Excel product import.

**Current Best Practice**:
1. Dedicate time blocks for logo management
2. Process 10 brands at a time
3. Prioritize by sales volume:
   - **High priority**: Top 20 best-selling brands
   - **Medium priority**: Brands with 5+ products
   - **Low priority**: Brands with 1-2 products (use emoji)
